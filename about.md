## This website

This website is entirely static. It works only with HTML, CSS and a little of JavaScript.

I paid particular attention to typography and spacing. The goal is to make the text readable. You won't find funny fonts or colors here.

A cookie is used to remember which theme (Light or Night) you choose.

The content is written in markdown. It is then processed by pandoc, a document converter, to obtain the different HTML web pages.

An RSS feed is provided if you want to be informed when new posts are published. The feed is generated with pandoc using a custom template.

Github pages is used to serve the site. All the code needed to generate the web pages, the RSS feed, as well as the end result can be found on my Github account.
