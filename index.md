## Welcome!

Hi, Léo here. Welcome to my small piece of internet. I wrote to put words on thoughts I have. I display them here for everyone to see. Look around: you may find some posts of interest to you.

For the moment, I will write about informatics topics. I also want to talk about science related topics in the future, particularly linked to life sciences. And maybe some other random stuffs.

I am currently doing a Master of Science in Life Sciences Engineering at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/home/) in Switzerland.

## Articles

I wrote some [articles](articles/index.html) that you may find interesting. The [TODO list](lists/todo-list.html) is growing continuously. I only need to take the time to write them.

Recently, I wrote:

* [How to learn C](articles/how-to-learn-c.html)

## Chronicles

Here are some [chronicles](chronicles/index.html), posts that are events based written in chronological order. You can look at my [Hello World!](chronicles/hello-world.html) chronicle, a post about this website.

## Lists

Here is a [list](lists/index.html) of lists of useful things.
